# Board Game Rules Agent

A local AI assistant that answers board game rules questions with **cited, highlighted** references to the official rulebook — built for fast lookups during actual gameplay.

## Quick start

Install prerequisites:
- [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/): `curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh`
- [Ollama](https://ollama.com/download): download the macOS app, then `ollama pull qwen3-embedding`
- A [Together API](https://www.together.ai/) key (free tier works — this is the default LLM provider)

Then:

```bash
cd boardgame_agent
uv sync
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env and add your TOGETHER_API_KEY
boardgame-agent
```

Create a game in the sidebar, upload a rulebook PDF, and ask a question. That's it.

## Using the app

**Create a game and add documents.** Click **Add new game** — the new game is auto-selected. Upload PDFs or markdown files, or point to a folder. Each document gets a **tag** (default "rulebook") that you can edit anytime in the sidebar. Docling parses PDFs once (can take a few minutes for large rulebooks). The first query also downloads the SPLADE++ sparse model (~530 MB, one-time).

**Document tags.** Tags tell the agent what kind of document it's searching. The default is "rulebook" — use any label you want for additional documents (faq, errata, supplement, etc.). The agent sees all tagged documents and searches rulebook-tagged ones first, then consults others when needed. Tags are editable inline — changes apply instantly, no reindexing.

**Ask questions.** Type a rules question in the chat. The agent searches indexed documents, retrieves relevant pages, and returns a cited answer. Click any **citation chip** to view the source — PDFs show highlighted page images, markdown files show highlighted text.

**Rate answers.** Each response has ✅ and ❌ buttons. Accepted answers feed into the `get_past_answers` tool so the agent stays consistent with prior verified rulings. Click again to undo.

**Top-k slider.** Adjusts how many pages are retrieved per query. Takes effect immediately — no session reset.

**Web search (optional).** Requires a `TAVILY_API_KEY` in `.env`. When set, a checkbox appears in the sidebar to enable/disable web search. Add trusted domains (e.g., `boardgamegeek.com`) to restrict where the agent searches.

**Switching LLM models.** Use the dropdown in the sidebar. Changing the model resets the current conversation (you'll be warned first).

**Picture enrichment (VLM).** Board game rulebooks are full of icons, symbols, and diagrams that plain text extraction misses. Expand the **Picture enrichment** panel on any PDF document to describe these images with a local vision-language model. Three Docling-native VLM presets are available — SmolVLM (256M), Granite-Vision (2B), and Qwen2.5-VL (3B) — all run locally on Apple Silicon (MPS). Descriptions are embedded into the index so the agent can reference visual elements when answering questions. Re-enriching with a different model overwrites the previous descriptions and automatically re-indexes.

**Spread pages.** Some rulebooks use landscape two-page spreads. Check the **Spreads** checkbox on a document to split each landscape page into two logical half-pages. This improves both retrieval accuracy and citation highlighting for spread layouts.

**Rebuild index.** After changing the embedding model in `config.py`, click **Rebuild index** in the sidebar. This re-embeds all cached documents — extraction does not re-run.

## LLM providers

The default models use Together API, but you can use Anthropic, OpenAI, or any combination. Models and their providers are configured in `config.py` under `MODEL_OPTIONS` — map each model ID to `"together"`, `"anthropic"`, or `"openai"`. Only add API keys for the providers you use. If a key is missing when you select a model, you'll get a clear error telling you which key to set.

## Embeddings

Dense vectors via Ollama (default `qwen3-embedding`, 4096-d). Sparse vectors via FastEmbed SPLADE++. Results are fused with Qdrant-native RRF hybrid search. Any Ollama embedding model can be used — change `OLLAMA_EMBED_MODEL` in `config.py` and click **Rebuild index**.

Ollama launches automatically if the app is installed but not running.

## Supported document formats

- **PDF** — parsed by Docling with full bounding-box citations and highlighted page rendering
- **Markdown** (.md) — parsed by heading structure with text-based citation highlighting

Both formats are indexed identically (same hybrid dense + sparse vectors) and are searchable through the same tool. Adding new formats in the future requires only a new extractor — no reindexing of existing documents.
