## Core design principle

**The agent reasons iteratively when looking up a rule.** It starts by searching the most relevant source. After every search, it asks itself two questions:

1. "Can I fully answer now, with every claim grounded?"
2. "Is there anything in these results I don't understand?"

If yes to #1, it answers immediately. If yes to #2, it searches for the unknowns. This loop handles both simple questions (answered in one search) and complex multi-hop questions (requiring cross-references across documents) — without pre-classifying complexity.

This behavioral loop is entirely in the system prompt. It's not a separate planning system or graph structure. The LangGraph ReAct loop provides the mechanical loop; the prompt provides the reasoning intelligence.

## Document processing pipeline

### Extraction

```
PDF ──▶ Docling ──▶ per-page JSON with bounding boxes
                         │
                    (optional, on by default)
                         │
                    VLM enrichment: Qwen2.5-VL (3B, local, MPS)
                    describes each picture bbox visually
                    "Red starburst shape with the number 2."
                    (no interpretation of meaning — just shapes/colors)
```

**Why Docling?** It handles complex multi-column layouts, tables, and returns per-item bounding boxes with provenance. The bboxes are the foundation of the citation system — without them, we can't highlight specific text regions in the PDF viewer.

**Why VLM enrichment at extraction time?** Board game rulebooks communicate heavily through icons. Without VLM descriptions, picture bboxes have empty text and are invisible to search. The VLM prompt is deliberately minimal: "Describe exactly what you see: shapes, colors, numbers, and any text. Do not guess what it means or represents." Meaning resolution happens at query time through the agent's cross-referencing behavior.

**Package: `docling`** — PDF parsing with per-item bounding boxes
**Package: `pymupdf` (fitz)** — PDF rendering, page cropping, bbox coordinate conversion

### Chunking

```
per-page JSON ──▶ chunk_by_sections() ──▶ section-level chunks
```

Each page's bboxes are grouped by heading labels (`section_header`, `title`). Tables become isolated chunks. Lone headings merge into the following section. Each chunk preserves `original_bbox_indices` mapping back to the page's bbox array — this is how citations trace from chunk → page → rendered highlight.

### Embedding and indexing

```
chunks ──▶ dense embedding (Ollama) + sparse embedding (SPLADE++)
       ──▶ Qdrant upsert with both vectors + full payload
```

**Why hybrid (dense + sparse)?** Dense embeddings (semantic) catch paraphrasing — "shield" matches "defense." Sparse embeddings (learned term weights) catch exact terminology — "Barkskin" matches "Barkskin." Neither alone is sufficient for rules text, which mixes precise game terms with natural language descriptions.

**Why RRF fusion?** Reciprocal Rank Fusion merges the ranked lists from dense and sparse search without requiring parameter tuning. It's Qdrant-native and runs server-side.

**Package: `ollama`** — local dense embeddings (`qwen3-embedding`, 4096-d)
**Package: `fastembed`** — SPLADE++ sparse embeddings (learned term weights)
**Package: `qdrant-client`** — vector database with hybrid search and RRF fusion

---

## Retrieval pipeline

```
query ──▶ embed (dense + sparse)
      ──▶ Qdrant prefetch (4×k = 20 candidates, RRF fusion)
      ──▶ cross-encoder re-ranking (Cohere or local FastEmbed)
      ──▶ top k = 5 results formatted for LLM with bbox citation indices
```

### Two-stage retrieval

With `RETRIEVAL_TOP_K = 5`, the pipeline runs in two distinct stages:

**Stage 1 — Fast recall (Qdrant):** Qdrant retrieves **20 candidates** (`k * 4`), not 5. Dense embeddings (semantic) and sparse embeddings (term-based) each return their top 20, and RRF fusion merges the two ranked lists into a single list of 20. RRF is fast and casts a wide net, but it ranks by position in the merged lists, not by semantic relevance.

**Stage 2 — Precise ranking (cross-encoder):** The cross-encoder scores all 20 candidates against the query using cross-attention — a more accurate measure of relevance than vector similarity. It returns the **top 5 by score**. The other 15 candidates are discarded before the LLM sees anything.

**Re-ranking is filtering, not just reordering.** The cross-encoder narrows 20 candidates to 5 — the LLM never sees the 15 it filtered out. Without this stage we'd be stuck choosing between two bad options:
- Show the LLM all 20 candidates → wastes context, dilutes answer quality with marginal results
- Show the LLM Qdrant's top 5 by RRF rank → RRF only knows rank position, not semantics, so it can rank a tangentially related chunk above a directly relevant one

The cross-encoder is too slow to run on the full collection (millions of chunks), but fast enough to score 20 candidates per query. Vector search narrows millions to dozens; cross-encoder narrows dozens to a handful. This is the standard two-stage pattern for production RAG.

**Tunability:** The 4× multiplier is in `retriever.py` (`prefetch_limit = k * 4`). Increasing it (e.g., 10×) lets the cross-encoder consider more candidates, improving recall at the cost of latency. The current 4× is a balanced default.

### Why Qdrant + external cross-encoder

Qdrant does NOT support cross-encoder re-ranking natively. RRF fusion is rank-based math (`1 / (k + rank)`), not semantic scoring. Qdrant handles fast hybrid retrieval; the cross-encoder runs client-side on Qdrant's output. Vector database for scale, cross-encoder for precision.

### Re-ranker choice

**Cohere Rerank** is the default — highest-quality re-ranker available with a free tier (1,000 calls/month). Falls back to local **FastEmbed BGE-reranker-base** (~1GB) when no API key is set.

Cohere returns a `relevance_score` (0-1) per chunk via cross-attention. These scores are currently discarded after re-ordering — they could power a CRAG-style quality gate (see Future considerations).

**Package: `cohere`** — Rerank API (free tier)
**Package: `fastembed`** — local cross-encoder fallback (BGE-reranker-base)

### Formatted output to LLM

Retrieved chunks are formatted as:
```
=== DOCUMENT: The_Crew_Rules | PAGE 4 ===
[page text]

Bboxes (cite by index):
  [0] "First paragraph text..."
  [3] "Red starburst shape with the number 2."
```

The LLM sees document name, page number, and numbered bbox references. When it calls `submit_answer`, it includes these indices, which flow through to the UI as highlighted regions in the PDF viewer.

## Agent architecture

### LangGraph graph

```
planner ──▶ agent ◀──▶ tools ──▶ finalize ──▶ END
```

**Planner node**: Lightweight check — only detects when the answer is already in conversation context (follow-up questions, rephrased questions). On the first message, it's a no-op. All reasoning about what to search and how deep to go happens in the ReAct agent loop, not here.

**Agent node**: LLM with bound tools. Receives the system prompt (rebuilt fresh each call with current document list) and compressed message history. Makes tool calls until it calls `submit_answer`.

**Tools node**: Executes tool calls via LangGraph's ToolNode.

**Finalize node**: Extracts the JSON payload from `submit_answer`'s ToolMessage and writes it to `state["final_answer"]`. No LLM call.

**Recursion limit**: 15. The agent should answer within this. If not, the finalize node falls back to the agent's last text response.

**Message compression**: ToolMessages from previous turns are compressed to `"[retrieved N chars — already processed]"` to free context space. The agent only sees full results from the current turn.

**Package: `langgraph`** — stateful graph with ReAct loop, checkpointing, streaming
**Package: `langchain-core`** — message types, tool binding
**Package: `langchain-together/anthropic/openai`** — LLM provider integrations

### System prompt

The system prompt is the core intelligence of the system. It's rebuilt dynamically each call with:

- The current document list (names, tags, descriptions)
- A conversation-context skip marker (when planner detects a follow-up)

The critical section is "How to reason" — the introspection loop that teaches the agent to evaluate its own understanding after every search and keep going when gaps exist. This is what makes the agent cross-reference instead of answering from a single source.

### Tools

| Tool | Purpose | Produces citations? |
|------|---------|-------------------|
| `search_rulebook` | Hybrid search over indexed documents with tag filtering | Yes — doc_name, page_num, bbox_indices |
| `view_page` | VLM analysis of a rendered page image | No — helps the agent understand what to search for next |
| `search_web` | Tavily web search restricted to configured domains | Yes — URL + finding (no bbox) |
| `get_past_answers` | Semantic search over accepted Q&A history | No — used for consistency, not citation |
| `submit_answer` | Formats the final answer with merged citations | N/A — this IS the output |

**Citation hierarchy**: `search_rulebook` is the primary citation source. `view_page` is a comprehension aid — it helps the agent understand visual content, but the agent must then search for and cite the text-based rules. `search_web` provides URL citations but no bbox highlights.

---

## Picture bbox foundation

Docling labels every non-text visual element in a PDF as a `picture` bbox with coordinates. When VLM enrichment is enabled (on by default), a local VLM (Qwen 3B via MLX) adds a text description to each picture bbox:

```json
{
  "label": "picture",
  "x0": 224.2, "y0": 383.9, "x1": 325.2, "y1": 296.7,
  "text": "Red starburst shape with the number 2.",
  "_vlm_model": "qwen"
}
```

The VLM prompt is deliberately minimal: *"Describe exactly what you see: shapes, colors, numbers, and any text. Do not guess what it means or represents."* This produces objective visual descriptions without hallucinating game meaning.

These descriptions are embedded into chunks and indexed, making visual elements searchable via normal RAG. When the agent retrieves a page, it sees the descriptions in the bbox listing and can reason about them.

**What's missing:** The link between a visual description ("red starburst with 2") and its game-semantic meaning ("difficulty level 2" or "order token 2"). The agent's introspection loop may find this through cross-referencing — many rulebooks explain their iconography in a components section. For games where it can't, this is an open problem.

**Future direction:** A mechanism to identify each unique icon and link it to its definition in the rulebook — like a join table from visual description to game meaning. The picture bboxes with coordinates provide the structural foundation for this. The linking strategy is still being designed.

## Data storage

### SQLite (`games.db`)

| Table | Purpose |
|-------|---------|
| `games` | Registered games (game_id, game_name) |
| `documents` | Indexed docs per game (path, tag, description, VLM model, spreads) |
| `game_search_domains` | Per-game allowed web search domains |
| `qa_history` | Past Q&A pairs with embeddings for semantic lookup |

### Qdrant (local, file-based)

Single collection `rulebook_pages` with:
- Dense vectors (`qwen3-embedding`, cosine distance)
- Sparse vectors (SPLADE++, RRF-compatible)
- Payload: game_id, doc_name, doc_tag, page_num, text, bboxes, original_bbox_indices

Filtered by `game_id` on every query. Optionally filtered by `doc_tag`.

### File system

```
data/games/{game_id}/
├── docs/           # Stored document files (PDF, markdown)
└── extracted/      # Cached Docling extraction JSON (one per document)
```

Extraction is cached — Docling only runs once per document unless forced. VLM re-enrichment overwrites the cached JSON and triggers reindexing.

## UI architecture

### Streamlit layout

└──────────┴────────────────────────┴────────────────────┘
```

Layout is adjustable (Chat / Equal / PDF presets). Citation clicks update the document viewer with highlighted bounding boxes.

### Agent caching

The compiled LangGraph agent is cached via `@st.cache_resource` keyed on `(game_id, model_name)`. Web search and page vision are always registered as tools but gated at call time via `agent_config` — toggling them mid-conversation takes effect on the next query without rebuilding the agent or losing chat history. Only changing the model resets the conversation.

---

## Key design decisions and rationale

**Why ReAct introspection instead of a planner?** An early version classified questions as SIMPLE/COMPLEX upfront and generated retrieval plans. This was abandoned because question complexity can't be known before searching — a "simple" question about a shield spell may require cross-referencing three rule sections. The ReAct introspection loop discovers complexity at runtime, which analogues how humans actually look up rules.

**Why citations are mandatory?** The `submit_answer` tool requires citations. The system prompt says "you must call submit_answer to finish." This forces the agent to retrieve before answering — it can't hallucinate a rule because it has to point to where the rule is written. This is the most important quality control mechanism in the system.

**Why VLM descriptions are purely visual?** The extraction VLM prompt says "Do not guess what it means or represents." A 3B model guessing game meanings would hallucinate — the same icon means different things in different games. Visual descriptions are objective. Meaning resolution happens at query time through the agent's cross-referencing behavior.

**Why `view_page` results are not citable?** VLM analysis helps the agent understand visual content, but it's not a source. "The VLM told me this icon means X" is not evidence — "the rulebook page 12 says this icon means X" is evidence. The agent must follow up VLM understanding with text retrieval to produce citable answers.

**Why Cohere over local re-ranking?** Cohere Rerank consistently outperforms open-source alternatives and has a free tier sufficient for a rules agent. The local FastEmbed fallback exists for offline use.

**Why not a knowledge graph?** A knowledge graph of game mechanics would help with multi-hop reasoning, but it requires game-specific ontology design. The current approach (introspective cross-referencing) handles multi-hop without game-specific structure. A knowledge graph may be worth exploring if the current approach hits limits on very complex rule interactions.

---

## Future considerations

**Corrective RAG (CRAG) — retrieval quality gating.** The Cohere re-ranker returns a `relevance_score` (0-1) per chunk that we currently discard after re-ordering. The CRAG pattern ([arxiv:2401.15884](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.15884)) uses these scores to classify each retrieved chunk as Correct/Ambiguous/Incorrect before the LLM sees them. Low-scoring chunks are filtered out; if most chunks score poorly, the agent is told retrieval quality was low and should reformulate or try a different source. This would give the introspection loop a concrete signal instead of relying entirely on the model to judge content quality. Implementation requires calibrating score thresholds for the board game rules domain (~30-50 test queries per Cohere's guidance).

**RAGAS evaluation framework.** Reference-free metrics (context precision, context recall, faithfulness) for offline evaluation across a curated question set. Useful for measuring improvement across model and architecture changes. Target: faithfulness > 0.8.

**Task-specific re-ranker fine-tuning.** Generic re-rankers score for topical relevance, but board game rules questions need "answer utility" — a chunk may be topically relevant but not contain the specific rule. Fine-tuning a re-ranker on game rules data could improve precision, but requires collecting labeled examples.
